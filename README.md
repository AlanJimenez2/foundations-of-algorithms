# Foundations of Algorithms

I’m beginning my journey into algorithmic thinking through classic books.

## Motivation
As I understand it, algorithms can be seen as concrete expressions of mathematical ideas.  
I believe in their power to deepen our understanding of mathematical thinking, and I hope that, step by step, this knowledge may someday contribute to building a better world.

## What you'll find here
- Solved exercises from classic books
- Personal notes and reflections
- Reviews of influential papers related to algorithms and discrete mathematics

## Structure
The repository is organized by books and topics, usually as subfolders, along with notes on important papers.

## Status
Work in progress.  
*Humility keeps us grounded, doubt keeps us honest, and wonder keeps us alive.*
