# The Art of Computer Programming

Here I review the books of the series and begin my journey into algorithmic thinking.

## Motivation
I’m a big fan of Donald Knuth, which is why I decided to study and review his work in a systematic way.

## What you'll find here
- Solved exercises from different volumes of the series
- Personal notes and reflections on the material

## Structure
The repository is organized by volumes of the series.

## Status
Work in progress.  
*Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do.*
